Contributing
============

Found a bug? Have an issue?
---------------------------

The fastest way to get feedback on contributions/bugs is create a `GitHub
issue`_ or catch me on `Twitter`_.


Where are the tests?
--------------------

Good that youâ€™re asking. The repository test suite is located in ``tests``
directory. Ensure the all tests are passes and there is sufficient code coverage for
your proposed change before submitting a pull request.
